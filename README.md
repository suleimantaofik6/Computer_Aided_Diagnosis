# CADx PROJECT: SKIN LESION CLASSIFICATION CHALLENGE USING CLASSICAL MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH 
This repository contain the code for the classification of skin lesions through a classical machine-learning (ML) approach employing a range of ML classifier models. The approach addresses both two-class and three-class problems, improving classification accuracy despite huge class imbalances and lesion variations.

## DATASET
The challenge dataset includes images from the [HAM10000](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DBW86T), [BCN_20000](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/bcn-20000), and [MSK_datasets](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/msk), offering a rich variety of dermatological samples for analysis.
